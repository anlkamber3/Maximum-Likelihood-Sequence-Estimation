## LaTeX Equations

To include LaTeX equations in your README, you can use an online LaTeX equation editor like [Codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) to generate an image of your equation. Then, use the image URL in your README file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Write your equation in the LaTeX format on the online editor.
2. Generate the equation image.
3. Right-click on the image and copy the image address.

### Example

Here's an example of a LaTeX equation in this README:

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})

This displays the quadratic formula.
